Test repository to practice with Github  

# Ethan's Github Method
After a bit of experimentation, I've found that an easy way to use GitHub is to combine it with Atom text editor which you can download [here](https://atom.io/)
Here is a quick guide to getting set up (Note there are many ways to accomplish these goals)

### Step 1: Download GitHub Desktop
This will be your hub for cloning repositories onto your PC. Make sure to sign in and it is easy enough to get going, it will also allow you to easily interact with Atom. 

### Step 2: Using Atom
You can create branches as well as make commits directly from Atom. To do this use GitHub Desktop to open a repository with Atom. Then add your code by creating new files in your cloned repository folder or edit existing files. 
Open the git tab to see all upstaged changes. 

To stage a change, add a commit message and then commit to the appropriate branch or create a new branch using the menu at the bottom of the git tab. Remember that commits are not made until you select push from the bottom menu.
